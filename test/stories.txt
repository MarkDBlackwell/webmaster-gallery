By means of other software (not the application) a webmaster shall upload thumbnail webpage files.

The application:
o if a thumbnail webpage file is new, shall process it.

Thumbnail files shall be distinguishable from picture files in their filenames.

A webmaster shall be able to log into the application.

For each picture, a webmaster can enter:
o a calendar year.
o a description.
o a title.

A gallery placeholder is the precise string of characters, '<%= @gallery %>'.

The application shall replace a gallery placeholder by a series of thumbnail expressors.

A thumbnail webpage file shall contain one or more picture tag list placeholders.

A user, with one click, can move from seeing the thumbnails for a chosen picture tag, to seeing all of the thumbnails.
