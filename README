An art gallery, made for the first client of the app (the generated static
pages) is visible here:

  http://www.meganamoss.com/webmas-gallery/

The app was designed for individual webmasters who use a web-hosting service,
and it has been installed (and run) on cPanel.

User stories for webmasters and users (gallery viewers) were written and are
updated and accurate:

  test/stories.txt

For a quick start, to developer testing of the app, using Test/Unit, see:

  test/quick-start.txt

All the app's tests passed, as of Rails version 3.0.3.
