#-------------
With IBM PC-compatible keyboards, Bash-related keys are:
'C-' - Ctrl (left or right)
'M-' - left Alt
'Rubout' - Backspace
'newline, return' - Enter
'home'(?) - Home

READLINE (section):
Readline key bindings:
By default, $INPUTRC is not set and ~/.inputrc does not exist, so default key
bindings are in effect.
Searching:
('home', newline) - terminate search
Commands for moving:
(C-a) - beginning-of-line
(C-e) - end-of-line
(M-f) - forward-word
(M-b) - backword-word
(C-l) - clear-screen
Commands for manipulating the history:
(C-r) - reverse-search-history
(M-C-y) - yank-nth-arg (See Numeric arguments, below.)
Commands for changing text:
(C-q, C-v) - quoted-insert
(M-t) - transpose-words
Killing and yanking:
(C-k) - kill-line
(C-x Rubout) - backward-kill-line
(M-d) - kill-word
(M-Rubout) - backward-kill-word
(C-y) - yank
(M-y) - yank-pop (following yank)
Numeric arguments:
(M-0, M-1, M--) - digit-argument
Completing:
(TAB) - complete
(M-?) - possible-completions
(M-/ M-/) - complete-filename (like glob-complete-word)
(C-x /) - possible-filename-completions
(M-$ M-$) - complete-variable
(C-x $) - possible-variable-completions
(M-@ M-@) - complete-hostname
(C-x @) - possible-hostname-completions
(M-! M-!) - complete-command
(C-x !) - possible-command-completions
(M-TAB) - dynamic-complete-history
Miscellaneous:
(C-_) - undo
(M-g) - glob-complete-word (like complete-filename)
(C-x C-v) - display-shell-version

HISTORY EXPANSION (section):
Event designators:
(!) - start a history substitution
(!-n) - nth previous command
(!string) - most recent command starting with string
(!?string?, !?string) - most recent command containing string
(^string^string^) - quick substition in last command
(Examples):
(!!) - last command
(!-2) - command previous to last
Word designators:
(:) - start (sometimes omitted)
(0) - command word
(n) - nth word
(^) - first argument (word 1)
($) - last argument
(%) - word matched by most recent ?string? search
(x-y) - range of words
(-y) - words 0 to y
(*) - all arguments
(x*) - like (x-$)
(x-) - like (x-$) but omits the last word
(Examples):
(!^) - last command's first argument
(!:2) - last command's second argument
(!$) - last command's last argument
(!*) - all arguments of last command
(!!-) - all words of last command but the last
(!:-1 !:3-4 !:6*) - last command, dropping the second and fifth arguments
(!-2^) - second previous command's first argument
(!-2:2) - second previous command's second argument
(!-2$) - second previous command's last argument
(!-2*) - all arguments of second previous command
(!%) - word matched by most recent ?string? search
(!-3:0 !*) - third previous command word and last command's arguments
(!-2:0 !:3* !-2$) - second previous command word plus its last argument, the
 last command's third and following arguments intervening
