Hello,
For troubleshooting purposes, I installed an empty, fresh, default Rails
application and gave it a name, 'try'.

To do this, I used the Cpanel page, 'Manage Ruby on Rails Applications'
<http://your_user_namess.com:2082/frontend/x3/ror/index.html>.

I ran, 'Create Ruby on Rails Application'. (This presumably uses Rails version
2.3.8 from the server-installed gem.)

There, I selected environment, 'development' and ran, 'Create A Rewrite'
(which offered port 12009). The files generated by Rails have not been changed.

After clicking 'Run', 'Manage Ruby on Rails Applications' shows 'App Status' of
'Running'. The app's mongrel log </home/your_user_name/rails_apps/try/log/
mongrel.log> seems clean, and reports: 'Starting Mongrel listening at
0.0.0.0:12009'.

However, 'Network Timeout' error happens when I try to connect to <http://www.
your_user_namess.com:12009>. I can see the request in the raw access log:
<68.33.57.32 - - [15/Feb/2011:07:29:57 -0800] "GET /try HTTP/1.1" 404 2628 "-"
"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.16) Gecko/20101123
SeaMonkey/2.0.11">. Doing <ps aux | grep your_user_name> informs me the Rails
application is running, started by </usr/bin/ruby /usr/bin/mongrel_rails start
-p 12009 -d -e development -P log/mongrel.pid>.

I wonder why the HTTP GET request directly to port 12009 <https://www.
your_user_namess.com:12009> is not being passed to mongrel or perhaps to the
app? I seem to recall there is something to be adjusted to make this work. Is
that right? Or should I use port 80 and the Apache rewrite?
